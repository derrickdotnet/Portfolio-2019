  <span class="about">
<p>I'm Derrick Jones, but call me DJ. I'm into UX design because I really like computers,
  and I really like people. Empathy, technology,
  and storytelling are some of the tools I use to design a reality that is good for all.
  <br>
  <br>
  I love to create, love to learn, and love to experience simple things in life,
  like riding a bike, being in nature, making music, drawing, and ruminating on my thoughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bikes are the love of my life (if you couldn't tell), and so are martial arts,
  coffee in all its forms, doing anything with friends, and exploring the world.
  <br>
  <br>
On my travels, I like to make new friends and understand their experiences,
and eat some (a lot of) food. I aim to have a slice of pizza from every nation on the planet.</p>
