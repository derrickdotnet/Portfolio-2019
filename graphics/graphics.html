  <a href= "../images/mars-logo.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/mars-logo.png" width="70%"></a>
  <p>This is a design for an embroidered cloth patch, button, sticker, and other small accessories.
    The theme for this commision was "subervsion". Subversion has a negative and confontational connotation to it, and I made
    this to have a positive and uplifting connotation.
    <br>
    <br>
    A positive form of subvert is surpass. Going on a manned mission to Mars would surpass the
    expectations and boundaries of all of humanity, and be another giant leap for mankind.

  <a href= "../images/kraus-title.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/kraus-title.png" width="70%"></a>
  <p>A title card for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qr_2lBTuPs">music video</a> for the New York based musician, Kraus.
    The director who wanted it
      to have a wavy, psychedlic, and erratic aesthetic.
      I listened to the song and looked at the available footage to get a better understanding. I created
      a design that emulated the energy I felt from the video and the song.
      <br>
      <br>
      My client was more than satisfied with the final result.
      This music video ended up being one of the pieces that got him accepted into
      graduate school for film directing at DePaul University in Chicago.

  <a href= "../banner/banner.html" target="_blank"><img src="../images/banner-screen.png" width="35%"></a>
  <p>I made an animated advertisement banner optimized for desktop browsing using HTML5, CSS, and Greensock.js.
    <br>
    <br>
    Having only done animation in AfterEffects, this projects was a challenge but fun to do and took a short time to learn.
    Animation gives the user the sense that what they're interacting with is alive and "breathes".
    <br>
    <br>
    It's a small addition that can make a big difference in UX.

  <a href= "../images/trans-business-card.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/trans-business-card.png" width="70%"></a>
  <p>A business card for a trans person's meetup event to spread awareness of using correct pronouns,
    and to increase social inclusivity for trans individuals.
      They wanted an eyecatching and immediately identifiable card. I was given an outline of what content should be on the card.
      and I utilized the colors of the trans flag and placed the content on the front and back perpindicular to each other,
      making it more engaging and memorable.
      <br>
      <br>
      Feedback from the client and participants in their meetup event was positive. My client was estatic with the first
      run of the card, and the participants said that the card made them reinforce what they had learned at the event;
      it had expanded their perspective and increased their empathy towards trans peoples.

  <a href= "../images/uncommonitems-new-ad.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/uncommonitems-new-ad.png" width="70%"></a>
  <p>A print ad for a small women's boutique in Milwaukee's East Side neighborhood. The owner was searching for someone to
      redo her web and print communications, and I completed the work for her for free.
      <br>
      <br>
      See more about this project <a href="../uncommon/uncommon.html">here.</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      The orignial print ad I was given was cluttered, hard to read, and difficult to understand.
      I took the orignial content of the ad, gathered images from her social media pages, and created something
      from scratch.
      <br>
      <br>
      My client loved the new design and was impressed that it was only done in a couple of days. She said that it conveyed
      the idea and vibe of her store. This was for a project for school and I could not accept a payment,
      but I was glad to have helped a small business with my expertise and give her joy.
