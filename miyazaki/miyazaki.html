  <p>The Miyazaki Museum is a personal project showcasing the films of animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his work
    with Studio Ghibli. This is also a study in UI design, responsive layouts, and user experience design as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  I went in with a mobile first mindset, and it reflected in the sketches in the sketches.
  From here I went straight to designing a high fidelity mockup.
  <br>
  <br>
  I created multiple versions of the desktop layout with minute changes in each. I wanted to play around with different ideas
  to see what they would look like in realiry. I conducted some A/B testing for the screens
  to see which versions people liked the most.
  Aftrer getting an even split of opinions, I chose to combine elements of the mobile and desktop UI for the final product.

  <p>It's easier to add complexity to something simple than it
      is to simplify something complex. From the mobile screens I created the tablet and desktop versions. I took into account the additional width that came
      with larger devices and incorporated a design that would utilize take advantage of the extra room.
